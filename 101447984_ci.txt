Continuous Integration (CI) in DevOps is the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository frequently. Each change is automatically tested through builds and automated tests to catch issues early. CI helps developers identify bugs quickly, improves code quality, and ensures that the codebase remains in a deployable state at all times, speeding up development and reducing integration issues.
