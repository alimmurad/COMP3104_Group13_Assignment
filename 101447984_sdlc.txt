DevOps is crucial in the software development cycle because it bridges the gap between development and operations, enabling faster, more efficient, and reliable software delivery. By automating processes like testing, deployment, and monitoring, DevOps ensures continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), reducing errors and improving collaboration across teams. This leads to shorter development cycles, quicker feedback, and the ability to respond rapidly to market or user needs, ultimately enhancing software quality and user satisfaction.
