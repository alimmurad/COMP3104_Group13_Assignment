DevOps is crucial in modern software development cycles as it bridges the gap between development and operations teams, allowing for faster delivery and better collaboration.
Automation in the SDLC, made possible through DevOps, reduces human errors, improves efficiency, and ensures that code is deployed consistently across environments.
Real-world applications of DevOps in the SDLC include:
- Continuous deployment of web applications to improve user experience.
- Automated testing and quality assurance to ensure code reliability.
- Monitoring and logging systems to track application performance post-deployment.
