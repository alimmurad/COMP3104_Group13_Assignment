Two types of averages are used. The term / semester Grade Point Average (G.P.A.) 
is based on the courses taken in a single term / semester, while the Cumulative Grade Point Average
(C.G.P.A.) takes into account all credit courses taken at the time of calculation.

A term/semester G.P.A. value of 1.70 (Diploma/Certificate Program) 
or 2.3 (Degree Program) is the minimum qualification for promotion from one term/semester to the next.
A cumulative G.P.A. value of 1.70 (Diploma/Certificate Program) 
or 2.3 (Degree Program) is the minimum graduation requirement.
A cumulative G.P.A. value of 3.50 (Diploma/Certificate Program) 
or 3.7 (Degree Program) is the minimum requirement for HONOURS.
College policies regarding the clearing of failures and Divisional requirements are considered in addition to the above. 
Refer to Division promotional policies for program specific requirements.

CRED – Credit is defined as – One credit equals one hour of instruction per week over the duration of the term/semester.

PTS – Points is defined as – the product of the CRED and GRD (Grade Point Value Equivalent).
