DevOps (Development and Operations) is a set of practices and cultural 
philosophies aimed at improving collaboration between development and IT 
operations teams. The goal of DevOps is to streamline and automate the 
processes of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), enabling 
teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with higher quality. It
 emphasizes continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD),
 automation, and monitoring to improve the efficiency of the software lifecycle.
