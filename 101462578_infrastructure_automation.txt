1. Introduction to Infrastructure Automation:
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables automated provisioning and management of infrastructure.
   - Common tools include Terraform, Ansible, and AWS CloudFormation.

2. Benefits of Infrastructure Automation:
   - Consistency: Ensures that all environments are configured identically.
   - Scalability: Automates the scaling of resources to meet demand.
   - Speed: Speeds up the provisioning process, reducing manual work.

3. Tools for Infrastructure Automation:
   - **Terraform**: Allows the provisioning of infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms.
   - **Ansible**: Manages configuration and deployment using simple YAML files.
   - **AWS CloudFormation**: Manages AWS infrastructure through code.
